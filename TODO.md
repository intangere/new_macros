- macros that do not generate in place shouldn't generate a file lol
- neither should macros that only execute code
- [done]: annotated consts
- [done]: annotated structs
- [done]: generate code into the package level. you can inject into f.Decls
- package scope
- [should be fixed with the default pre-clean option]: ignore actually restores generated files ontop of the newly generated ones. this is a bit of a problem
